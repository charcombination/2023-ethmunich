Context
## The NFT-lending market is has been plagued with volatility and speculation. Furthermore, online gamers have valuable game assets that they cannot easily use as collateral in alternative to physical assets such as a car, electronics or jewelry.
Nivalend is developing an NFT lending platform that will be collateralized with game assets, tied to the stable and reliable market prices of games like CS:GO, Dota 2 and PUBG.

Traditional loans and credit products may not be accessible or may require lengthy application processes and credit checks. Nivalend offers a unique money-lending platform that allows online gamers to use their game assets as collateral for loans, providing them with quick and easy access to cash without having to go through traditional loan application processes.
